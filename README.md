**Live Face Analysis in Browser**

This is a web-based, real-time face analysis application that runs entirely in the browser using the `face-api.js` library. It detects faces and analyzes expressions, gender, and facial landmarks from a webcam feed.

**How to Run**

1.  Download the `recognition.html` file.
3.  Open the file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
4.  Allow the browser to access your webcam when prompted.
